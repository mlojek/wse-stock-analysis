# WSE stock analysis
Using statistics to prove a stock trading strategy.

## The strategy
We propose that buing stocks that dropped more than 8% in one day is a good and reliable trading strategy. To prove this, we'll use statistical tools and records of the 20 biggest stocks from Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) by market cap.

## Dataset:
We're using [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hadzio/warsaw-stock-exchage-onbalance-volume-obv) dataset from kaggle. It contains information about open, close, low and high prices for each stock for each trading day. We'll limit our tests to years 2010-2018, to exclude major global recessions.
